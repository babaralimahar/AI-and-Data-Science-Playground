    "Before we dive into what Deep Learning is - let's review some applications of Deep Learning in our everyday life:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Self Driving Cars:__\n",
    "Vehicles like Teslas have networked cameras and various other sensors fitted around the car which provide vast amount of data that is fed to an AI model that learns to identify all sourounding objects and predict what the best next action for the vehicle is. The AI model simulates human perception and the descision making process using Deep Learning under the hood. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Netflix Recommendation Engine:__\n",
    "A major contribution to Netflix's business model is its recommendation engine that enables customer rentention. Netflix gathers a vast amount of data of their user base including viewer ratings, viewing histories, wathing preferences etc - all of these data points are fed into machine learning models to generate models that can provide you a personalised recommendation based on your own preferences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Face Recognition:__\n",
    "A multitude of applications are able to identify and tag people in pictures and videos. A task which is very easily performed by humans, even if faces change or are abstructed with accessories. However, until recently this has remained a challenging computer vision problem for many decades. These days, models are able to leverage Deep Learning and utilise big datasets of faces to learn similarities and develop face recognition capabiilties that even outperform humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above examples fall under the field of Artificial Intelligene which is essentially the theory and development of computer systems that perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Machine Learning is the application of AI based around the idea that computer systems should not be explicitely programmed but learn by experience and acquire skils without human intervention. \n",

    "<center><div> <img src=\"graphics/venn_diagram.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 450px;\"/></div> </center>\n",

    "Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses __Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)__ at its backbone. ANNs are often described as mimicing the human brain through a set of algorthims. \n",
    "A major difference between machine learning models and ANNs is that the former lacks the mechanism to identify errors and requires human intervention to tune the model for more accurate decision. Whereas ANNs can identify the inaccurate decision and self-correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a very high level, a neural network comprises of __Input, Hidden and Output Layers__ that are made up of interconnected Nodes which resemble the way that biological neurons in the human brain signal to another.\n",

    "First of all, DL has additional abilities compared to basic ML algorithms. It automatically learns representations from data without introducing any hand-coded rules or human domain knowledge. For example, to detect apples on a production line using machine learning, you might need to manually code the extraction of particular features like the roundness of an apple, its weight, or color, to help the machine to learn. DL needs no such instructions and can perform this *feature extraction* by itself.\n",

    "Said that, the choice between DL or ML can be based on the data we are analysing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the data is small, deep learning algorithms don't perform that well. This is because deep learning algorithms need a large amount of data to extract and *understand* meaning patterns. In this case, a regular machine learning algorithm may deliver more accurate results.\n",

    "In this notebook we will work through a code example of a simple and shallow neural net. Before doing so, we should consider the *business use-case*. Our scenario will look at house price prediction, is there a business use case here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the ability to use AI-powered prediction is a real advantage. If done well, an estate agent that uses accurate predictions for the properties they deal with has a big advantage over an estate agent that uses human experts to make these predicitons, the AI-powered company can operate much more efficiently, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "A new property is brought to the estate agent, a form describing the property is filled out and entered into a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The traditional company must then pay a human expert to make an initial price estimate, this can take time and estimates can be affected by human error or even the mood of that person on that day. If the expert is unfamiliar with the area the house is located in, or typically deals with smaller houses, their prediction take longer (costing the estate agent more money), and be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The AI-powered company has a program that automatically feeds this new data into the house prediction neural net, returning an estimate almost instantaneously. The neural net can do this for millions of new houses almost every second, the costs of running this neural net are minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Already we can see the potential of something like this, however, it must be done carefully and a human may still need provide a final estimate. There is the case of *Zillow*, a real-estate marketplace that used AI to power a rapid home buying and reselling tool called *\"Zillow Offers\"*. Zillow Offers was their AI-powered house price estimation tool, that provided start-to-end house pricing with little human oversight, unfortunately this turned out very poorly for Zillow who quickly shut down Zillow Offers, wrote off $569M worth of homes, and laid off 25% of its staff [\\[source\\]](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-happened-at-zillow-how-a-prized-real-estate-site-lost-at-ibuying/).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, other companies such as Opendoor and Offerpad seem to have implemented AI powered price estimates with much more success [\\[source\\]](https://www.protocol.com/manuals/proptechs-big-moment/ibuyer-opendoor-offerpad-zillow), showing that this approach can be implemented successfully, if done right."

We will cover this in more depth in future chapters, but the reason for this is that our network is unable to represent complex relationships with only a few weights. However, when we take the same concepts discussed above and apply them across multiple layers with more neurons and adjustable weights/biases more complex relationships can be represented. "
